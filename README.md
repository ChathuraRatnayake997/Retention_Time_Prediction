### Model Performance

The performance of the trained model is summarized by the following metrics:

| Metric                | Score   |
| --------------------- | ------- |
| **R² Score**          | `0.633` |
| **MAE** (minutes)     | `1.605` |
| **RMSE** (minutes)    | `2.262` |

-   **R² Score (Coefficient of Determination):** Indicates that the model explains approximately 63.3% of the variance in the retention times.
-   **MAE (Mean Absolute Error):** On average, the model's predictions are off by about 1.6 minutes.
-   **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):** A measure of the error magnitude, giving higher weight to larger errors.
